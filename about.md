Hi!  

My name is Gurur Sarbanoglu (aka The Bru, hence the blog title). I am a London-based UX designer, currently working at a large B2B data analytics company. I started this blog in September 2014, but things got in the way and so I was finding it very difficult to update it with fresh content. And when a WordPress update destroyed my child theme (my fault), thisisthebru was left to gather dust in a dark corner of the internet.

As you can see, it is back up online, albeit with a different style and platform.
