excerpt: The annual countdown of my favourite albums from the last 12 months.
---
Curious which albums shivered my timbers in 2014? Before revealing the list, here are some interesting stats:  

* I bought, legally borrowed, and was gifted **85** studio albums this year  
* **11** of these albums were by solo artists, the remaining **74** were by bands  
* **55** of these bands or artists were from the US, followed by **9** from Sweden and **8** from England. The other represented nations were Australia (**3**), Canada (**3**), Brazil, Iceland, Mexico, The Netherlands, Scotland, Switzerland, and Wales (all **1**)  
* **8** albums were either debut releases or debut LPs, whilst **22** were debut purchases from me (i.e. I had never bought any albums by those bands before)  

Without further ado, [hereâ€™s the list](/top-50-albums-of-2014).
