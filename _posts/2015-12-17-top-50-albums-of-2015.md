excerpt: The annual countdown of my favourite albums from the last 12 months.

As with many things in life, hindsight throws some curveballs. Again, as with many things in life, some of these curveballs are easy to deal with. In the grand scheme of things, the changes I would make to these lists is negligible in importance compared with some of the other curveballs one deals with elsewhere. A day after publishing this list, I bought another album which would alter the countdown.
